Hereâ€™s a polished and detailed **README** file template tailored for your project:

# **Image Migration to AWS S3**  

A Node.js application for migrating product images from local storage to an AWS S3 bucket, updating MongoDB with the newly generated S3 URLs for seamless integration with the DatabaseNAME system.  

## **Features**  
- Fetches product details from MongoDB.  
- Uploads local images to AWS S3.  
- Updates product image URLs in the database with S3 links.  
- Error handling and detailed logging for every step of the migration.  

---

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **AWS Services**: S3 (Simple Storage Service)  
- **Others**: MIME, Body-Parser  

---

## **Setup and Installation**  

### Prerequisites  
1. **Node.js** installed (v14.x or later).  
2. **MongoDB** installed and running locally or on a remote server.  
3. An **AWS S3 bucket** set up and configured.  

---

### **Steps to Install**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/EcomTEST-image-migration.git  
   cd EcomTEST-image-migration  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:  
   ```env  
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/{Your Database Name} or mongoDB URL
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id  
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key  
   AWS_REGION=your-aws-region 
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name  
   ```  

4. Update the `LOCAL_IMAGE_PATH` in `migration.js` if your image folder path differs:  
   ```javascript  
   const LOCAL_IMAGE_PATH = path.join(__dirname, 'assets/images');
   ```  

5. Start the server:  
   ```bash  
   node app.js  
   ```  

---

## **Endpoints**  
## **USE POSTMAN APPLICATION FOR TESTING.**
### **1. Migrate Images**  
**POST** `/api/products/migrate-images`  
- Description: Triggers the image migration process.  
- Response:  
  - **200 OK**: Migration completed successfully.  
  - **500 Internal Server Error**: Migration failed with error details.  

---

## **Usage**  
1. Ensure all product details are in the MongoDB database under the `testimages` collection.  
2. Ensure images are located in the `assets/images` folder with filenames matching the `images` field in your MongoDB documents.  
3. Use a tool like Postman to call the `/api/products/migrate-images` endpoint to start the migration process.
